      <p>"That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..." -
         Over 100 years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose
         of existence seemed to be to devour humans. There was an insurmountablr gap in power between them and mankind, and as a result,
        humanity was rapidly exterminated to the brink of extinction. The survivors responded by constructing three concentric wall: Wall 
        Maria, Wall Rose and Wall Sina, whhich graced them with a century of peace. However, one day a colossal Titan far larger than any 
        other seen before breached the outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans to invade humanity territory and forcing the survivors to 
        retreat to the inner walls. Eren Jeager, a boy whose mother was eaten during the invasion, vowed to wipe every last Titan off the 
        facae of the Earth, and joined the military determined to exact his revenge. </p>
